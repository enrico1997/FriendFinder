# Wizard Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "WizardFinder" application similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from wizards' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other wizards. The app will then display the name and picture of the wizard with the best overall match. 

I used Express to handle routing and deployed it to https://morning-bayou-96475.herokuapp.com/.

* Check out [this demo version of the site](https://friend-finder.herokuapp.com/) that I used as inspiration for this application.

### Instructions

1. The survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Once I determine the current user's most compatible wizard, I display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal displays both the name and picture of the closest match.
